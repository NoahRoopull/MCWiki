  <h1>Gamemodes</h1>
  <p>
    Upon creating a world, players are given three options for game mode: Survival, Creative, or <a href=gamemodes.html#hardcore>Hardcore.</a> Survival and Hardcore are similar, but creative offers a whole different possibility.<br>
    <a href="#survival"><h2>Survival</h2></a><br>
    Survival mode is the default game mode for Minecraft. In survival, you have health, hunger, armor, visible XP, and you cannot fly. You can interact with the world, such as destroying and placing blocks, killing and breeding mobs, and moving items to and from chests. You can take fall damage, and all <a href="effects.html">status effects</a> will have an effect on gameplay. For a guide on survival, see <a href="survivalGuide.html">this page</a>.
    <a href="#creative"><h2>Creative</h2></a><br>
    Creative mode offers much more versatility in the way of movement and block choices. In creative mode, you are invulnerable, hunger, armor, and XP are not visible, and you can fly. In you inventory, you also have a wide array of <a href="items.html">items</a> and <a href="blocks.html">blocks</a>, including (almost) every item in the game, as well as a tab to save hotbars if you're switching between items often, and a tab for your inventory that simulates its survival counterpart, showing armor slots, an inventory, and your character in a viewport. By default, <a href="commands.html">cheats</a> are enabled, allowing you to more easily change entities and the world around you. For a building guide, see <a href="buildingGuide">this page</a>
    <a href="#adventure"><h2>Adventure</h2></a><br>
    Adventure mode is not a default option from the world creation screen, but it is in the game for <a href="maps.html">maps</a> that require control over the player. In adventure mode, you cannot break or place blocks without them being specifically for that purpose, and you cannot fly. You also have health, hunger, armor, and XP. Players can interact with chests, use items, and attack and otherwise interact wiht mobs. This is optimal for adventure maps, as it stops players from destroying the map, but allows them to move and interact.
    <a href="#spectator"><h2>Spectator</h2></a><br>
    Spectator mode is not available from the world creation screen, but it is often used in <a href="multiplayer">servers</a> to let players, as the name suggests, spectate. In spectator mode, the player can move freely, even through blocks, and can also enter a mob's view by clicking on it. Some mobs even have special filters over the camera when being used by the player. One example is the creeper, which has a green filter over the entire screen. This view can be exited by clicking again. Spectators can also look inside chests, but cannot take or place items into or from them.
    <a href="#difficulties"><h2>Difficulties</h2></a><br>
    Each world has a difficulty and a gamemode. Gamemode affects the player, but difficulty often effects the world and other mobs instead.
    <h3>Peaceful</h3>
    Peaceful difficulty is for players new to sandbox videogames, or anyone wanting to build without enemies. In peaceful difficulty, the Saturation <a href="effects.html">effect</a> is constantly applied, keeping the player's hunger level full. In turn, the player's HP often regenerates very quickly. <a href="hostileMobs.html">Hostile mobs</a> also do not spawn in peaceful difficulty, and if they are spawned by the player, they immediately despawn. The only exception is the Ender Dragon. Certain mobs, like <a href="hostileMobs.html#wolves">wolves</a> also will not attack players, and <a href="blocks.html#tnt">TNT</a> does not damage the player. While peaceful difficulty makes it easier to survive, the player can still die from fall damage, lava, drowning, and other various forms of damage like cactus and magma.
    <h3>Easy</h3>
    Easy difficulty is for players who are new to survival mode, or have trouble in higher difficulties. Enemies deal less damage, and many mobs have a poorer view, meaning they are less likely to find the player. Raids also have 1-2 fewer waves, meaning that there are fewer enemies the player needs to defeat. Players will also never be taken below five health from starvation.
    <h3>Normal</h3>
    Normal diffculty is the default difficulty. Mobs deal normal damage, and raids have the normal amount of waves. The player will be brought down to one health point from starvation.
    <h3>Hard</h3>
    Hard difficulty is for players who need more of a challenge. Mobs deal extra damage, raids have more waves, <a href="hostileMobs.html#spider">spiders</a> can spawn with <a href="potions.html">effects</a> including strength, invisibility, speed, and regeneration. They are twice as likely to spawn with speed as anything else. <a href="hostileMobs.html#enderman">Endermen</a> also have a chance to spawn with invisibility. When either has invisibility, nothing but their eyes and effect particles are visible. <a href="hostileMobs.html#creeper">Creepers</a> are also more likely to spawn charged, meaning the explosions will deal more damage. Players can also die from starvation, and all <a href="passiveMobs.html#villager">villagers</a> killed by <a href="hostileMobs.html#zombie">zombies</a> will become zombie villagers.
    <a href="#hardcore"><h2>Hardcore</h2></a><br>
    Hardcore mode is a version of survival. In Hardcore mode, the difficulty is locked to Hard, <a href="commands.html">cheats</a> are locked to off, and the player only has one life. Upon dying in Hardcore mode, instead of "You Died!", the screen displays "Game Over!". The player also only has the options to Spectate the world, putting them in spectator mode, and returning to the title screen. Staying alive is much more important in hardcore, for obvious reasons, and keeping items in chests is less essential, because if the player dies, the world ends.
