  <h1>Gamemodes</h1>
  <p>
    There are 4 gamemodes:<br>
    Survival: Player can interact with the world, break blocks normally, and cannot fly. Player has health, hunger, saturation, and air.<br>
    Creative: Player can interact with the world, breaks all blocks instantly, and can fly. Player is completely invulnerable, and the health, hunger, armor, air, and XP bars do not appear above the hotbar. Commands are also enabled by default to creative worlds.<br>
    Adventure (only available with commands): Essentially Survival, but the player cannot break blocks without specifically crafted items.<br>
    Spectator (only available with Hardcore mode and commands): Player cannot interact wiht the world, can pass through blocks, and can fly. Health, hunger, armor, air, and XP bars do not appear. Spectator players can also click on an entity to view everything from the entity's perspective, and view items in containers, but cannot interact with them. After dying in Hardcore mode, the player is only allowed to respawn in spectator mode.<br>
  </p>
  <h1>Difficulties</h1>
  <p>
    There are 4 difficulties, which are separate from gamemodes:<br>
    Peaceful: The player has infinite saturation, and, indirectly, hunger. This means that the player has constant passive regeneration. Hostile entities will not spawn, and most neutral entities will either not attack the player, or attack for a shorter period. The Ender Dragon still spawns in Peaceful difficulty.<br>
    Easy: All hostile and neutral entities deal less damage to the player, and starvation will not deal damage to the player if they are at 10 or less health. Zombies will never convert Villagers into Zombie Villagers. Vidicators cannot break doors down. Entities that spawn with armor never spawn with a full set.<br>
    Normal: Mobs deal normal damage, and starvation will bring the player to 1 health. Zombies convert Villagers into Zombie Villagers about 50% of the time.<br>
    Hard: Mobs deal extra damage, and many effects from mobs last longer. Starvation can kill the player, and Zombies always convert Villagers into Zombie Villagers. Zombies can also break down wooden doors, and may call "reinforcements", a small group of zombies nearby, when attacked.<br>
  </p>
  <h1>Hardcore</h1>
  <p>
    Hardcore mode is a more difficult version of survival: Commands cannot be enabled, nor the Bonus Chest, and the difficulty is locked on Hard. The player's health bar also looks different, and upon death, the player is turned into a Spectator. This means that if the player dies, they cannot play on the world anymore.
