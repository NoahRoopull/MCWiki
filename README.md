# Minecraft Wiki, but not bad

Gamepedia is gone, as Fandom has bought it and converted all of the once-amazing wikis into abominations, including Minecraft's.
I'm just trying to make a wiki that isn't overrun with ads, and hopefully this one will turn out to be more useful than Fandom's new wiki.

This wiki is less technical, and that is on purpose. This is supposed to help new players get used to the game, and technical pages will be made available.

Feel free to submit pull requests!
Note: Even though I am trying to "undermine" Fandom, I do not endorse copy/pasting information nor will I accept it as a pull request.
