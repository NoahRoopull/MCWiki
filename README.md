# Minecraft Wiki, but not bad

Gamepedia is gone, as Fandom has bought it and converted all of the once-amazing wikis into abominations, including Minecraft's.
I'm just trying to make a wiki that isn't overrun with ads, and hopefully this one will turn out to be more useful than Fandom's new wiki.

This wiki provides only the needed information, and some pages may be brief.

Feel free to submit pull requests!
Note: Even though I am trying to "undermine" Fandom, I do not endorse copy/pasting information nor will I accept it as a pull request.
