# Minecraft Wiki, but not bad

Gamepedia is gone, as Fandom has bought it and converted all of the once-amazing wikis into abominations, including Minecraft's.
I'm just trying to make a wiki that isn't overrun with ads, and hopefully this one will turn out better than Fandom's new wiki.

Feel free to submit pull requests!
Note: Even though I am trying to "undermine" Fandom, I do not endorse copy/pasting information nor will I accept it as a pull request.
